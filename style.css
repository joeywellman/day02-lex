/* ## Lightning Exercise 2 
- Create a file called `style.css` and link to your HTML file.
- Give your nav bar and your nav elements appropriate BEM classes
- In `style.css`, apply the following styles:

    - Nav elements should have black text
    - Nav elements should have Helvetica font
    - Nav elements should not have any underline (hint: use the `text-decoration` property) */
